## Data Structures
* [ ] Describe the difference between a stack and a queue and give examples of when you might use them.

## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.

Queue : data structure based on FIFO (first in first out), it means that queue will act just like a normal queue, and it can be used for alot of problems, such as waiting list, printing jobs queue, or if your program make meals :P

Stack : data structure based on LIFO (Last in first out), which means if i always want the last value to come first when i need then i will use stack. it can be used for problems like comparing balanced parantheses (every closing with the last openeing), fibunacci numbers and function call stack.

main differnce in the order of removing elements
